# hello-world
my first repository

Hi,

I am Andra Draghiciu, a student at OTH Regensburg in my last semester. Currently I'm workind on my Bachelor's Degree, which I have to get done until the March 14th, 2019. 

I'm developing a Pill Doser based on Arduino and coded with Xamarin. I'm trying to develop an Android App to control the doser.
